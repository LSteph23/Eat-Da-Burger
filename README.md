# Eat-Da-Burger!
This is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

# Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

I have built an application meant to log your burgers with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. The app design pattern follows a MVC structure; using Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.
